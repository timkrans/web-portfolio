    <p class="lead text-center">
      Hi, I'm Timothy! I'm passionate about creating meaningful experiences through technology and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey began as a curious coder, experimenting with websites in high school. Over time, I
      honed my skills in web development, working on projects that blend creativity and functionality.
      I'm driven by curiosity, a commitment to learning, and the desire to build tools that make lives
      better.

    <p>
      Outside of work, you'll find me exploring photography, diving into sci-fi novels, or honing my skills
      in new technologies. I believe in lifelong learning and always strive to grow as a person and professional.
